    "question": "What is a database in the context of software systems?",
    "answer": "A database is an organized, persistent collection of logically related data designed to meet the information needs of an organization. It represents some aspect of the real world (the miniworld) and is built to be shared by multiple users and applications. Unlike a simple file system, a database minimizes redundancy and allows for efficient querying and data management. For example, a social media platform's database stores user profiles, posts, comments, and connections in separate but interrelated tables, enabling complex features like news feeds and search.",

    "question": "What is a DBMS and what are its primary functions?",
    "answer": "A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software suite that provides a systematic and scalable way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data in a database. It acts as an intermediary between the database and end-users/application programs. Its core functions include: data storage and retrieval, concurrency control to manage simultaneous access, security and authorization, integrity enforcement to ensure data accuracy, and backup and recovery. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB.",

It was one of the first systems to demonstrate that a relational database management system could be implemented with practical performance. Its two major subsystems were: 1. **Research Storage (RS):** Managed the low-level storage of data on disk. 2. **System Relational Data System (RDS):** Provided the higher-level relational interface, including the pioneering SQL query language (then called SEQUEL).

    "answer": "Data independence is the immunity of application programs to changes in the definition and organization of data. It is a fundamental benefit of the three-schema architecture. There are two types: 1. **Physical Data Independence:** The ability to modify the physical schema (storage structures, indexing) without needing to change the logical or conceptual schema. Applications are shielded from changes like switching from one storage engine to another. 2. **Logical Data Independence:** The ability to modify the conceptual schema (adding a new column, splitting a table) without having to change existing external schemas (views) or application programs, as long as the data they use remains available.",

    "answer": "A view is a virtual table derived from one or more base tables. It does not store data itself but represents a stored query. Views are crucial for logical data independence because they create an abstraction layer. Users and applications can interact with views instead of base tables. If the underlying base tables need to be restructured (e.g., a table is split), the view's definition can be updated to reconstruct the original virtual table for the user. This means the application's interface to the data remains unchanged, insulating it from changes in the database's logical structure.",

    "question": "What is database normalization and what are its goals?",
    "answer": "Normalization is a systematic process of decomposing (breaking down) complex database tables into smaller, simpler tables to eliminate data redundancy and avoid data anomalies. The primary goals are: 1. **Minimize Data Redundancy:** Store each piece of data only once to save space and prevent update anomalies. 2. **Eliminate Anomalies:** Prevent inconsistencies that can occur during data insertion, deletion, and updating. 3. **Simplify Data Integrity:** Make it easier to enforce integrity constraints. The process involves analyzing tables based on their functional dependencies and primary keys.",

    "answer": "A Functional Dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation. It is denoted as X - Y, meaning that the set of attributes X functionally determines the set of attributes Y. This implies that for any two tuples (rows) in the relation, if they have the same values for X, they must also have the same values for Y. X is called the determinant. Functional dependencies are derived from the real-world meaning of the data and are fundamental to the process of normalization.",

    "answer": "The Storage Manager is a crucial DBMS component that provides the interface between the low-level data stored on disk and the rest of the DBMS components (e.g., the query processor). It is responsible for: 1. **Managing Storage:** Allocating space on disk for database files. 2. **Managing Data Structures:** Implementing and managing efficient file structures for storing data (e.g., heap files, hashing) and indexes. 3. **Translating Requests:** Converting the logical requests for data (e.g., 'get row with id=5') into low-level commands to read from or write to the physical storage system.",

It is simple and safe but requires database downtime, making it unsuitable for 24/7 systems. * **Hot Backup (Online Backup):** Performed while the database is running and open for use. This allows backups without downtime.

It is considered ideal for several reasons: 1. **Stability:** It never changes, unlike natural keys (e.g., an email address can change). 2. **Simplicity:** It is usually a single, numeric column, making joins and indexing very efficient. 3. **Anonymity:** It reveals no information about the entity it identifies. 4. **Uniqueness Guarantee:** The system ensures its uniqueness. While natural keys exist in the business domain, surrogate keys are often preferred for internal system efficiency and maintenance.",

    "answer": "Data constraints are rules enforced on data columns to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the data in a database. The main types are: 1. **Domain Constraints:** Ensure a column's value is of a valid data type and falls within a defined set of values or range (e.g., `Age` must be a number between 0 and 120). 2. **Entity Integrity Constraints:** Ensure each row is uniquely identifiable (Primary Key constraint: unique and not null). 3. **Referential Integrity Constraints:** Ensure relationships between tables remain consistent (Foreign Key constraint). 4. **User-Defined Integrity Constraints (CHECK):** Enforce custom business rules that are specific to the application (e.g., `EndDate` must be after `StartDate`).",

    "answer": "A recursive relationship is implemented by adding a foreign key column within the same table. This column references the primary key of another row in the same table. For example, to model an employee hierarchy in an `EMPLOYEE` table: 1. The table has an `EmployeeID` primary key column. 2. It also has a `ManagerID` foreign key column. 3. The `ManagerID` column contains the `EmployeeID` of the employee who is the manager of the current employee. It references the `EmployeeID` column in the same table. If an employee has no manager (e.g., the CEO), the `ManagerID` would be NULL. Queries on such tables often use self-joins (joining the table to itself) to navigate the hierarchy.",

    "answer": "The major goals of OLE DB were to: 1. **Provide Universal Data Access:** Create a single, unified interface for accessing data from any source, relational or non-relational. 2. **Component Object Model (COM) Based:** Use the COM standard to define interoperable objects for data access, promoting software reusability. 3. **Increase Flexibility:** Allow data providers to expose functionality in pieces, enabling them to implement only the features they supported. 4. **Avoid Data Movement:** Provide a means to access and manipulate data in place, in its native store, without requiring it to be moved or converted into a different format first.",

    "question": "In OLE DB, what distinguishes an interface from an implementation?",
    "answer": "This is a core concept of COM, which OLE DB is built upon: * **Interface:** A contract. It is a defined set of properties and methods that an object must expose. It specifies *what* an object can do, but not *how* it does it. OLE DB defines standardized interfaces. * **Implementation:** The actual code inside the object that fulfills the contract specified by the interface. It defines *how* the properties and methods work. The implementation is hidden from the user (data consumer). This separation allows a provider (implementation) to change its internal code without breaking any applications that use it, as long as it continues to honor the interface contract.",

    "answer": "The key difference is in their purpose: * **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Designed for *presenting* and displaying data in a web browser. It uses a fixed set of tags that describe appearance (e.g., ` `, ` `). It mixes structure, content, and presentation. * **XML (eXtensible Markup Language):** Designed for *storing and transporting* data. It is extensible--you define your own tags that describe the meaning of the data (e.g., ` `, ` `). It provides a clear separation between the structure of the data, the data itself, and its presentation. This makes XML self-describing, portable, and far superior for data exchange between heterogeneous systems.",

    "answer": "To define the legal structure, elements, and attributes of an XML document, you use a schema language: 1. **Document Type Definition (DTD):** The older, simpler method. It defines the basic structure with a list of legal elements and attributes. An XML document that conforms to its DTD is 'valid'. 2. **XML Schema Definition (XSD):** A more powerful and modern language written in XML itself. XSD provides much stronger data typing (e.g., integers, dates), supports namespaces, and allows for more complex constraints than DTD. XSD has largely replaced DTD for most serious data exchange applications.",

Requires ODBC to be configured on the client machine. Legacy and not recommended for production. 2. **Type 2: Native-API Driver (Partly Java Driver):** Uses the client-side libraries of the database. Converts JDBC calls into calls to the native API (e.g., OCI for Oracle). Requires native libraries on the client. 3. **Type 3: Network-Protocol Driver (Pure Java Driver for Middleware):** Uses a middleware application server that converts JDBC calls into a database-independent network protocol. The middleware then translates this to the database-specific protocol. 4. **Type 4: Database-Protocol Driver (Pure Java Driver):** Directly converts JDBC calls into the network protocol used by the DBMS. This is a direct-to-database pure Java driver. It is the most common and efficient driver type for most applications (e.g., MySQL Connector/J).",

In an ERD, this is represented by a double line connecting the supertype to the circle. (e.g., Every `Vehicle` in the database MUST be either a `Car` or a `Truck`). * **Partial Specialization:** An instance of the supertype *can* be an instance of a subtype, but it is not mandatory. It is represented by a single line. (e.g., An `Employee` could be a `Manager` or a `Engineer`, but some employees might not be classified into either subtype).",

Its primary key is the primary key for the entire hierarchy. 2. **Subtype Tables:** Each subtype table contains two types of columns: a) The primary key of the supertype (which is also the primary key of the subtype table and a foreign key back to the supertype). b) The attributes that are unique to that specific subtype. This design supports the 'is-a' relationship and allows for efficient querying of all instances (via the supertype) or just specific types (via the subtypes).

The data is persisted to disk. It is extremely fast to query because it avoids recomputing the join and aggregation, but the data can become stale.

    "answer": "JavaScript and VBScript are client-side scripting languages primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages within a user's browser. * **JavaScript:** A versatile language developed by Netscape. It became the dominant client-side scripting standard due to its cross-browser support. It is used for tasks like form validation, creating dynamic menus, and interacting with the HTML Document Object Model (DOM). It is not related to Java. * **VBScript:** A scripting language from Microsoft based on Visual Basic syntax. It was primarily used to script web pages in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. It never achieved cross-browser adoption and is now largely obsolete. Both executed code on the client machine, reducing the load on the web server but depending on the browser's capabilities.",

This involves resolving naming conflicts, data type differences, and encoding inconsistencies. 3. **Nonvolatile:** Once data is entered into the warehouse, it is not updated or deleted in the same way operational data is. It is a stable, read-only environment for analysis. Data is loaded and refreshed, not changed. 4. **Time-Variant:** Data is stored to provide a historical perspective.

This gap is caused by two main factors: 1. **Data Silos:** Operational systems are typically built independently for specific functions (e.g., sales, inventory, HR). This leads to data being stored in isolated 'silos' with different structures and meanings, making it difficult to get a unified, enterprise-wide view. 2. **Differing Processing Needs:** The primary design goal of operational systems is to support high-volume transaction processing, not complex decision-support queries. Running analytical queries directly on operational systems would degrade their performance, creating a technical barrier to accessing information.

Its primary goal is to ensure the **isolation** property of transactions, preventing problems like lost updates, dirty reads, and unrepeatable reads. The two main approaches are: 1. **Pessimistic Concurrency Control:** Prevents conflicts by locking data before it is used. This is the most common method. 2. **Optimistic Concurrency Control:** Allows conflicts to occur but detects them at transaction commit time.

The basic rules are: * Before a transaction can read or write a data item, it must first acquire the appropriate lock. * If a lock is held by another transaction, the requesting transaction must wait. * Locks are released when the transaction commits or rolls back. The main types are **shared locks** (for reading) and **exclusive locks** (for writing). The lock manager subsystem of the DBMS is responsible for granting and tracking locks.",

For example, a `Customer` table could be fragmented so that customers from the East Coast are stored on a server in New York, and customers from the West Coast are stored on a server in California. A predicate (e.g., `Region = 'East'`) defines each fragment. * **Vertical Fragmentation:** Splits a table by **columns**. Each fragment contains a subset of the table's columns.
